Mon Oct 16 01:01:39 2006 [free_speech] Tricky wonders why no-one uses this to flame n00bs.

Tue Oct 24 18:22:51 2006 [free_speech] Tricky: Morning. 
Tue Oct 24 18:27:44 2006 [free_speech] Fokke@fokkemud: Tricky, noone uses this to flame n00bs, because traditionally that's what imud_code was for 
Tue Oct 24 18:28:22 2006 [free_speech] Fokke@fokkemud: which I always found retarded. It was a channel for code discussion, but if you brought up a topic slightly below PhD computer science level, you were flamed 
Tue Oct 24 18:30:52 2006 [free_speech] Tricky: channel-0505 ?!?

Mon Feb 12 02:25:57 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: nobody wants to listen to you fucktard

Mon Feb 26 23:18:52 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: not even able to muster out a 'kike' or a 'raghead' 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:10 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: because it's amateur hour over there. 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:32 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they were just talking about you in fact 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:34 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: they've forgotten how to hate. 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:38 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Bunny told me. 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: calling you a mexican crybaby 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:42 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: There are spies everywhere. 
Mon Feb 26 23:19:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh 
Mon Feb 26 23:20:04 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: are you fuckups going to link up or not? 
Mon Feb 26 23:20:14 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I don't want to have to put any effort forth into patching my shit 
Mon Feb 26 23:20:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm doubting arren will do it for real 
Mon Feb 26 23:20:32 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i think she will either 
Mon Feb 26 23:20:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 1) find some reason it's unacceptable 
Mon Feb 26 23:20:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 2) find some way to make it unacceptable to me 
Mon Feb 26 23:21:02 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: like demanding acceptance of the adsr policies? 
Mon Feb 26 23:21:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: or refusing to accept any rules at all 
Mon Feb 26 23:21:44 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: in reality, there will always be a way around pety disagreements 
Mon Feb 26 23:22:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and i think i've shown a great willingness to bend over backward to set up irn 
Mon Feb 26 23:22:30 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: i always knew this community was totally gay,, but it never really struck me how gay. 
Mon Feb 26 23:22:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but given how i cant figure out what she does or doesnt want, given the dichotomies between what she says and what she does 
Mon Feb 26 23:22:52 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it seems unlikely she's serious about "not fragmenting" 
Mon Feb 26 23:22:58 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: well, time will tell 
Mon Feb 26 23:23:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and would rather "win" that anything else 
Mon Feb 26 23:23:18 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I've come to terms with the fact that peoples selfish goals are going to make me have to fuck with this stupid i3 implementation 
Mon Feb 26 23:23:24 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I do feel very put off. 
Mon Feb 26 23:23:30 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: what about MY needs? 
Mon Feb 26 23:23:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i am SO altruistic 
Mon Feb 26 23:23:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i am like jesus over here 
Mon Feb 26 23:23:54 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: The Gay Jesus 
Mon Feb 26 23:24:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the hot gay jesus 
Mon Feb 26 23:24:12 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: the one from Reefer Madness: The Musical 
Mon Feb 26 23:24:20 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: With a hot gold loincloth 
Mon Feb 26 23:24:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'll have to "rent" that 
Mon Feb 26 23:24:46 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: It's moderately funny.  It parodies the original, and has a pretty good cast. 
Mon Feb 26 23:24:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh for one thing, what i look forward to is 
Mon Feb 26 23:25:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: arren trying to work out rules and an enforcement policy 
Mon Feb 26 23:25:10 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: don't let your neighbors see you watch it or they'll think you're a stoner. 
Mon Feb 26 23:25:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that'll be a hoot 
Mon Feb 26 23:25:22 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: why?  that seems contrary to the stated goals 
Mon Feb 26 23:25:30 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's easy to throw stones at the hall onitor 
Mon Feb 26 23:25:32 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: i've thought about being a spammy whore 
Mon Feb 26 23:25:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: sucks to be in charge of the hall 
Mon Feb 26 23:27:15 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: I never went to school, so I never got to senselessly abuse people. 
Mon Feb 26 23:38:14 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: for what it's worth, i just introduced Bunny to the magna carta. 
Mon Feb 26 23:48:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs i've seen it spelled magna charta 
Mon Feb 26 23:48:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs surely she wasnt comPLETELY unaware of it 
Tue Feb 27 00:31:38 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: The fifth amendment of the US constitution (you know, that stupid one about guns) is a rip-off of Clause 36 of the Magna Carta. 
Tue Feb 27 00:31:50 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Oh wait, bzzt 
Tue Feb 27 00:32:00 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Freedom of speech I meant 
Tue Feb 27 00:32:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs the 5th amoendment isnt about guns or free speech 
Tue Feb 27 00:32:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs the 2nd is the gun name 
Tue Feb 27 00:32:40 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Which is why I went "Oh wait, bzzt" 
Tue Feb 27 00:32:44 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs the 5th is about self incrimination 
Tue Feb 27 00:33:00 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Which is more or less free speech 
Tue Feb 27 00:33:12 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs eh 
Tue Feb 27 00:33:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs the first is the free speech one 
Tue Feb 27 00:33:28 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Still a rip-off of Clause 36 of the Magna Carta 
Tue Feb 27 00:33:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs test 
Tue Feb 27 00:33:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fs hmm

Tue Feb 27 00:34:14 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Must be losing it. I usually get thrown off within 1 minute of goading Merkins 
Tue Feb 27 00:35:04 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: In fact, that is another thing we Brits gave the world. 
Tue Feb 27 00:35:44 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Democracy. 
Tue Feb 27 00:36:11 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you can't give democracy to people 
Tue Feb 27 00:36:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: this is a lesson the usa is learning at some great cost 
Tue Feb 27 00:36:23 2007 [free_speech] Tricky now understands why this channel never took off. 
Tue Feb 27 00:36:43 2007 [free_speech] Tricky tuts 
Tue Feb 27 00:37:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's like giving people pate de foie gras 
Tue Feb 27 00:37:09 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You don't give people democracy. You ram it down their throat. 
Tue Feb 27 00:37:15 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: unless they were looking for it, they're like "eww" 
Tue Feb 27 00:37:23 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Look at India 
Tue Feb 27 00:39:47 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: In fact, look at all the ex-colonies of the British Empire. Ok, some didn't quite work quite right (parts of Africa) but it worked in the end. 
Tue Feb 27 00:40:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i wonder if the brits invented the word "jingoism" 
Tue Feb 27 00:41:01 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Most probably 
Tue Feb 27 00:42:53 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Of course the "fanatical patriotism" award would have to go to all the US public who shout "USA, USA, USA" during the olympics. 
Tue Feb 27 00:43:37 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: s/shout/chant/ 
Tue Feb 27 00:44:41 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: right 
Tue Feb 27 00:44:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: merkins have a monopoly 
Tue Feb 27 00:45:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: brits attend olympic games and just arch eyebors at one another 
Tue Feb 27 00:45:25 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: eyebrows 
Tue Feb 27 00:45:51 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Except during our "gay" World Cup when all England gets patriotic. 
Tue Feb 27 00:46:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: does your world cup want to suck the dick of other world cups? 
Tue Feb 27 00:46:45 2007 [free_speech] Tricky notes that due to Political Correctness we are not allowed to celebrate St George's day. 
Tue Feb 27 00:47:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: did you kill a bunch of sub-english on that day? 
Tue Feb 27 00:47:50 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Flag waving (St George's flag) is seen as an affront (or some such) to all the minorities here in Britain 
Tue Feb 27 00:48:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: hmmm 
Tue Feb 27 00:48:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well that's the price you pay for lord and mastery 
Tue Feb 27 00:48:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i will weep silent tears for you, oppressor 
Tue Feb 27 00:48:48 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Price you pay for being soft on immigrants. 
Tue Feb 27 00:48:56 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: hater! 
Tue Feb 27 00:49:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: whites dont spawn enough 
Tue Feb 27 00:49:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: without immigration the uk would implode economically 
Tue Feb 27 00:49:32 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Rest of Europe tell them to piss off, we say, "come here, have a slice of the tax payers money in handouts" 
Tue Feb 27 00:49:44 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: your government understand the long view 
Tue Feb 27 00:50:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: without a growing population, your economy dies 
Tue Feb 27 00:50:12 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Feh! Give them the vote (through handouts) and they get back in power 
Tue Feb 27 00:50:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and nigel and pamela dont have enough little broodlings 
Tue Feb 27 00:50:42 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Up the revolution. 
Tue Feb 27 00:51:38 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Give me a barrel of gunpowder and I will show the Fathers 4 Justice how to light up the proceedings of Parliament 
Tue Feb 27 00:52:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: mmm 
Tue Feb 27 00:52:06 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: That should have the filters at GCHQ twitching 
Tue Feb 27 00:52:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: mixing yer local pop culture references there 
Tue Feb 27 00:52:30 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i've got an image of a fat guy in a batman costume with a guy fawkes mask 
Tue Feb 27 00:52:40 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: They missed a trick there 
Tue Feb 27 00:53:12 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Interesting. I get an image of Americans as not knowing stuff like that 
Tue Feb 27 00:53:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh 
Tue Feb 27 00:53:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we want you to think we are all stupid and ignorant 
Tue Feb 27 00:53:38 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Especially F4J

Tue Feb 27 00:57:29 2007 [free_speech] Tricky nods. I probably know at lot less about the US. 
Tue Feb 27 00:58:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we're fat, stupid, and happy 
Tue Feb 27 00:58:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that's mostly it 
Tue Feb 27 00:58:27 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Bit like the scroungers here 
Tue Feb 27 00:59:11 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Council house scroungers

Tue Feb 27 01:07:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: afk 
Tue Feb 27 01:07:48 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: http://www.chavscum.co.uk/ 
Tue Feb 27 01:11:22 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Yeesh! http://chavscum.co.uk/4images/details.php?image_id=2701 
Tue Feb 27 01:25:56 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You are quite right, "fat, stupid and happy" - http://tinyurl.com/2zbx9x # NSFW 
Tue Feb 27 03:32:41 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: Are you goin gto map Arren's igossip to this channel 
Tue Feb 27 03:33:33 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: That is about as fragmented as you can get 
Tue Feb 27 03:34:07 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: The whole point of IRN is that it doesn't matter what router/server you are connected to the channel is the same 
Tue Feb 27 03:34:11 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Like IRC 
Tue Feb 27 03:34:45 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: But crat's ig has rules and arren's ig doesn't. Only the name is the same. 
Tue Feb 27 03:35:07 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: But the channel is owned by a mud. Not a server 
Tue Feb 27 03:35:41 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Like it or not, Frontiers owns ig 
Tue Feb 27 03:35:47 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: still not seeing it. 
Tue Feb 27 03:37:14 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: http://www.intermud.org/i3/channels.php3 
Tue Feb 27 03:37:20 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: 1st paragraph 
Tue Feb 27 03:37:38 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: "The protocol allows any mud to start a new channel with any policies that mud chooses to establish." 
Tue Feb 27 03:38:14 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: so, if I'm reading between the lines, arren will be required to delete Annares II's igossip to be able to successfully link to YI4 network. 
Tue Feb 27 03:38:16 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Note. Lima Bean owned ig on GJS 
Tue Feb 27 03:38:32 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Technically yes 
Tue Feb 27 03:38:52 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: That is one of the things that would need to be ironed out. 
Tue Feb 27 03:39:10 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: If Lima Bean came on then... well 
Tue Feb 27 03:50:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's a good question 
Tue Feb 27 03:50:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: what if arrenroutar joined and they started spouting racist stuff on ig? 
Tue Feb 27 03:53:09 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You would have to take off your router admin hat and put on your mud admin hat. 
Tue Feb 27 03:53:45 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Or filter questionable text out with **** 
Tue Feb 27 03:53:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that's kinda lame tho 
Tue Feb 27 03:54:31 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: **** or chanban("imud_gossip", racistmud) 
Tue Feb 27 03:57:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but if i chanban 
Tue Feb 27 03:58:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: then they'll say "what was the point?" 
Tue Feb 27 03:58:33 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: I'm saying it already. Only just picking up on it now? 
Tue Feb 27 03:58:41 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You will just be following the rules of the channel policies 
Tue Feb 27 03:59:31 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so what should happen, then? 
Tue Feb 27 03:59:41 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: http://lpmuds.net/intermud.html#rebellion 
Tue Feb 27 03:59:47 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: should i shut down yatmim like arren wants? 
Tue Feb 27 04:00:08 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: I think DS muds can live on yatmin, and arren provides the gjs replacement router 6 months late. 
Tue Feb 27 04:00:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so you're a fragmenter, then 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:02 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: unless ig is mapped to free spech, which only just occurred to me this hour 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:12 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: sounds like a reasonable idea 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:18 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: did you fragment the community when you put up yatmin? 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yeah prtty much 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:34 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: took newbie ds muds off to your own safe newbie land? 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: "not fragmenting" is not my bag 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that's an arren thing 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: my deal was indeed fragmenting 
Tue Feb 27 04:01:56 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: I see no change from that time. 
Tue Feb 27 04:02:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: cuz gjs was such shite 
Tue Feb 27 04:02:18 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: except arren presumable will keep the router booted. 
Tue Feb 27 04:02:56 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ok 
Tue Feb 27 04:03:04 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but here's my question 
Tue Feb 27 04:03:04 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: One way you could do it is to downgrade yatmim to a Dead Souls interchat system with just dead_souls, dead_test4 and dchat on it. If DS admin want to join the big bad world then they could start up the main intermud daemon. 
Tue Feb 27 04:03:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: what was all this about not fragmenting? 
Tue Feb 27 04:03:38 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm perfectly ok with arren running her own router, and all non ds muds going to it 
Tue Feb 27 04:04:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i dont think theres a need to hide behind some sort of "greater good" disguise 
Tue Feb 27 04:04:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: her motives are bizarre in imperfectly articulated 
Tue Feb 27 04:04:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so i'm naturally suspicious 
Tue Feb 27 04:04:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but y'all should go on her router if ya think i'm such a louse 
Tue Feb 27 04:04:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i mean that sincerely 
Tue Feb 27 04:05:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm just doing exactly what i've said, consistently, throughout 
Tue Feb 27 04:05:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if that's not enough for ya, then godspeed 
Tue Feb 27 04:06:44 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i mean, you all know i *asked* her to start her own router, right? 
Tue Feb 27 04:07:04 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so complainy pants could go get on *her* nerves? 
Tue Feb 27 04:07:44 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it was when she got all histrionic about fragmenting the community that i started on the irn 
Tue Feb 27 04:08:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: which in retrospect, i should probably not have bothered with, considering she was unlikely to be serious 
Tue Feb 27 04:09:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so i dunno. i dunno what you want from me, malic. apparently whatever i'm doing just isnt good enough 
Tue Feb 27 04:09:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so i'm sorry 
Tue Feb 27 04:10:40 2007 [free_speech] Malic@Trilogy: No, in retrospect, you should have realized that once the routers were connected, you'd be back where you started. 
Tue Feb 27 04:11:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: not necessarily 
Tue Feb 27 04:11:47 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: once i deal with a fellow router admin, rather than a petulant whiner, things can be different 
Tue Feb 27 04:12:43 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: after all, i've yet to hear arren say the rules are the problem 
Tue Feb 27 04:12:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it was the enforcement that bugged her 
Tue Feb 27 04:13:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's not unreasonable to see her as a partner, if she's serious 
Tue Feb 27 04:16:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if that's all you have for me, i'll start getting into my pj's 
Tue Feb 27 04:16:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i can see you're angry with me 
Tue Feb 27 04:16:47 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but i hope you can see i really think i'm being reasonable 
Tue Feb 27 04:16:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i may be wrong or deluded 
Tue Feb 27 04:17:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but i'm not acting out of bad faith 
Tue Feb 27 04:49:04 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Going to bed. Will continue to hack away at the router tomorrow. I'm ditching the socket bit. Too confusing to follow. 
Sun Apr 22 05:06:48 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: if skulls were all the same, why are asians referred to as 'slopes'? 
Sun Apr 22 05:07:36 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: is that why they have slanty eyes? 
Sun Apr 22 05:08:08 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: and that is why we must kill them all 
Sun May 20 02:54:27 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: test 
Sun May 20 02:55:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: dumbass 
Sun May 20 16:01:57 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: foo 
Sun May 20 16:06:54 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: only to tell you to die 
Sun May 20 16:17:05 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: o i c 
Sat May 26 00:07:25 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: test 
Sat May 26 00:08:15 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: is this free speech? 
Sat May 26 00:12:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that's deep, man 
Sat May 26 00:14:38 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: what's allowed on here that's too much for other lines? 
Sat May 26 00:15:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: whatever the law allows, i suppose 
Sat May 26 00:16:20 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: what kinds of things would be better here than igossip? 
Sat May 26 00:16:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: racist speech, commercial propaganda, spamming 
Sat May 26 00:17:20 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: http://lpmuds.net/intermud.html#rules 
Sat May 26 00:19:21 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: that's very reasonable 
Sat May 26 00:20:11 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh, i had thought so 
Sat May 26 00:20:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but not everyone agrees with your analysis 
Sat May 26 00:21:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: or urinalysis, for that matter 
Sat May 26 00:21:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: (tee hee, potty joke) 
Sat May 26 00:28:12 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I guess no one's in the mood to be wildly offensive 
Sat May 26 00:28:38 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I would say stuff just to be funny, but I'm not in the mood either :( 
Sat May 26 00:30:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: not a very big audience either 
Sat May 26 00:30:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: this channel isnt enabled by default on any lib i know of 
Sat May 26 00:31:10 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so there's probably a grand total of three epople listening right now 
Sat May 26 00:31:48 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: is there anything to do on dead souls demo? 
Sat May 26 00:32:04 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: ceci n'est pas une free_speech 
Sat May 26 00:32:16 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: zone 
Sat May 26 00:32:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: mmm 
Sat May 26 00:32:48 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i kid 
Sat May 26 00:32:57 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i dunno, you mean can one play? the answer is no, it's just a standard stock mud up as an example 
Sat May 26 00:33:02 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: whaaat, yuh say fonny tings, y'know? 
Sat May 26 00:33:26 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if yer looking for a job, sure there's chores to do, if you're bored enough 
Sat May 26 00:33:32 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud wonders if speech can be free as in gratuit but not free as in libre 
Sat May 26 00:33:36 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: we are the Party Of Three 
Sat May 26 00:33:54 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: free as in liber 
Sat May 26 00:34:46 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I guess that would be fascist, if someone could say whatever they want whenever they want as long as it's the party line 
Sat May 26 00:34:48 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: its not that i have an urge to be wildly offensive, 
Sat May 26 00:35:02 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: or, for that matter, have EVER had an urge to be widly offensive 
Sat May 26 00:35:11 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: or think i ever WILL feel that urge 
Sat May 26 00:35:41 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: so if speech could either be gratuit or libre I think libre would be better 
Sat May 26 00:35:50 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i dunno, i dont think i can 'splain it very well 
Sat May 26 00:36:27 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: please to explain: meanings of and difference between gratuit and libre 
Sat May 26 00:36:31 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: no wait 
Sat May 26 00:36:49 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: is gratuit "free as in beer", while libre is "gfree as in speech"? 
Sat May 26 00:36:55 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: yeah 
Sat May 26 00:37:07 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i reMEMber! i reMEMber! 
Sat May 26 00:37:21 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: well, i dont necessariuly remember, i just kinda took a guess 
Sat May 26 00:37:33 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i just like saying "i reMEMber! i reMEMber!" 
Sat May 26 00:37:41 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's funny that speech can be either though 
Sat May 26 00:38:33 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: heh, i got plenty of free speech for yuh 
Sat May 26 00:39:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well you two go on like that 
Sat May 26 00:39:25 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: so, is fireflymud based off the scifi show? 
Sat May 26 00:39:31 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm making a beer run 
Sat May 26 00:39:39 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: hmmm... guinnesss?

Sat May 26 01:08:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: meaning that you overheat really quickly

Sat May 26 01:08:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: because there's no way to convect the heat off you 
Sat May 26 01:08:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that is to say

Sat May 26 01:35:01 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i mean, thats deep 
Sat May 26 01:35:11 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i think i just made a funny

Sat May 26 01:36:40 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: thats like saying "i support this hammer to drive a nail into the wood" 
Sat May 26 01:36:52 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: yeah, it's really stupid how they set up a straw man with supporting the troops 
Sat May 26 01:36:54 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: what i might NOT support is the guy weilding the hammer 
Sat May 26 01:37:20 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: cause mebbe hes using a hammer to take care of a loose screw 
Sat May 26 01:37:42 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: then again, when alls ya got is a hammer.... 
Sat May 26 01:37:58 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: there's a difference between wanting to take care of people who are doing their job, and supporting the guy who gives the orders 
Sat May 26 01:38:28 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: yeah, but who puts the guys in charge... IN charge

Sat May 26 01:39:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: when everyone is guilty, nobody is guilty 
Sat May 26 01:39:24 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: of course, if ya vote for Mr Bad Politician, then yer partly to blame 
Sat May 26 01:39:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: there's an entire subset of german philosophy on just this point 
Sat May 26 01:39:38 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: but if you DIDNT vote for him, then mebbe you didnt Notvoteforhim hard enough 
Sat May 26 01:39:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: postwar of course

Sat May 26 01:41:25 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: whos th guy who said his favorite book was th bible (duh) and his favorite novel is "battlefield earth"? 
Sat May 26 01:41:31 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i think hes a mormon, too? 
Sat May 26 01:41:31 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: there are some obvious truths that they use nationalistic propaganda to polizarize people with 
Sat May 26 01:41:43 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: my brain hurts 
Sat May 26 01:42:01 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: population polarization is great

Sat May 26 01:43:01 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: aif grade erf scoience 
Sat May 26 01:43:25 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i remember some guy said it like that 
Sat May 26 01:43:27 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: it was funny 
Sat May 26 01:43:31 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: when reality is more like "if you want to support the troops don't believe the president" 
Sat May 26 01:43:37 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i think he stole somethign from me 
Sat May 26 01:43:53 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: and when yer a kid and someoen takes somethign from you and they wont give it back, what can yuh do? 
Sat May 26 01:44:29 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: i was once being silly, asking people "do YOU support th troops?" 
Sat May 26 01:44:47 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: or maybe i said "how do YOU suipport th troops?" 
Sat May 26 01:44:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: http://rugose.com/bush_on_timetables.jpg

Sat May 26 01:45:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: interestingly, bin laden has said that paying your taxes is sufficient to make you fair game 
Sat May 26 01:45:43 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so it's actually not so farfetched 
Sat May 26 01:45:47 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: on one hand, you dont go dumping money into some bottomless war pit with no plans for how to end it or win or whatever 
Sat May 26 01:46:01 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: on the other hand, 
Sat May 26 01:46:03 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: um

Sat May 26 01:47:53 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: back in th day, it was conserving fuel or tires or steel or whatever

Sat May 26 01:48:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: apparently the gasoline rationing was not actually about the gasoline 
Sat May 26 01:48:58 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: it was about CONTROL 
Sat May 26 01:49:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they were making people drive less to save rubber, not gas 
Sat May 26 01:49:03 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: just like the RIAA 
Sat May 26 01:49:14 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: save rubbers? what for

Sat May 26 01:50:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i might not go so far as to call him a genius 
Sat May 26 01:50:54 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: if its to control and exploit and make money and power and all that, then kudos! 
Sat May 26 01:50:54 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: if you give people tax breaks and everything, they don't care what you do anywhere else 
Sat May 26 01:51:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but he's almost certainly above average in intelligence 
Sat May 26 01:51:28 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: and above agerage in being a rich, white, christian, male person with family connections 
Sat May 26 01:51:28 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: they really know how to play the common man for fools

Sat May 26 01:52:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well

Sat May 26 01:53:20 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if the dems choose a stupid rich white guy, that will be the wasted opportunity 
Sat May 26 01:53:24 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: whaddaya mean, "hoping for an election"?

Sat May 26 01:53:30 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: wtf WOULDNT there be one? 
Sat May 26 01:53:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: since one stupid rich white guy is evidently indistinguishable from the next, even to white voters 
Sat May 26 01:53:52 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: the whole "cant change horses in midstream" thing? 
Sat May 26 01:54:10 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: there will be an election

Sat May 26 01:55:32 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: how botu this: if we were to ever cancel the presidential elections... 
Sat May 26 01:55:40 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: then the terrorists WILL have won 
Sat May 26 01:55:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that is a fair statement 
Sat May 26 01:56:12 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: th thing is, theyre "winning" in oh-so-many small ways 
Sat May 26 01:56:21 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: this is my favorite biography: http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/presidents/george-w-bush/

Sat May 26 02:16:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: by any measure it's a miracle he was reelected during the civil war 
Sat May 26 02:17:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so gwb has a ways to go before he gets my sympathy 
Sat May 26 02:17:55 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's probably really hard to not get re-elected during a war, fear keeps people in line 
Sat May 26 02:19:05 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's a lot harder for really good leaders in peace time, when people will complain about any little thing 
Sat May 26 02:21:18 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: there's really no reward for doing a good job

Sat May 26 02:38:46 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: pantheon, that's an interesting analogy 
Sat May 26 02:43:04 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: like a zip code, but more marble 
Sat May 26 02:43:44 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: now you've lost me

Mon May 28 00:12:40 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud finds something by George Carlin 
Mon May 28 00:15:54 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: http://www.erenkrantz.com/Humor/SevenDirtyWords.shtml 
Mon May 28 00:16:42 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Heh! Heard that sketch a lot of times and it still funny. 
Mon May 28 00:19:05 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Of that seven, "shit, piss and tits", aren't even up there on the "bad" list of words for UK TV 
Mon May 28 00:21:49 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Until I saw Carlin, I thought he was some "short-arsed bald headed jewish guy". That's the impression I got from hearing his sketches without seeing him. 
Mon May 28 00:22:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: he was funny when i was 13 
Mon May 28 00:22:05 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: hehheh 
Mon May 28 00:22:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: his shit gets old

Mon May 28 00:23:43 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Does shit fo white when it is old? Like the mythical white dog shit you used to see, but is no longer around on the streets. 
Mon May 28 00:24:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i wondered about the white shit 
Mon May 28 00:24:07 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: "Does shit go white"* 
Mon May 28 00:24:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i can only imagine it was municipal laborers spraying it with anti-stink 
Mon May 28 00:24:23 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Aliens 
Mon May 28 00:24:31 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: which is so odd 
Mon May 28 00:24:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: because it cant be that much more difficult to just pick it up 
Mon May 28 00:24:51 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: A bit like cow mutilations. Just experiments they do on us 
Mon May 28 00:25:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i mean, unless the white stuff is shit melting formula, SOMEone has to come get it 
Mon May 28 00:25:35 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: I think I did this sketch last year on ig. 
Mon May 28 00:25:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yess, it's off to see the fjords 
Mon May 28 00:26:37 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: The fjords of the mighty Slartybartfarst? 
Mon May 28 00:27:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i pine for them too. and it's slartibartfast 
Mon May 28 00:28:43 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Weird, I could have sworn it was "Slartybartfarst" the way it was pronounced. But alas you are right. All hail Crat! All hail Eris! 
Mon May 28 00:28:51 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Fnord! 
Mon May 28 00:29:49 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Heh! Fnord, fjord, it is a conspiracy I tell ya! 
Mon May 28 00:30:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: sluttyfartblast 
Mon May 28 00:30:36 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm trying to find this article I found one time when I searched for "green shit" 
Mon May 28 00:30:52 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it had a lot of good information, might have been on poopreport.com 
Mon May 28 00:30:56 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Alternative to ping-pong games? "sluttyfartblast" 
Mon May 28 00:32:32 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: http://www.heptune.com/poop.html 
Mon May 28 00:33:32 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: wikipedia used to have a picture of a human turd on a plate in the feces article 
Mon May 28 00:33:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: sadly, it is gone 
Mon May 28 00:34:50 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: BTW - I got your ref to pantheon, "Sat May 26 02:43:04 2007  [free_speech]  Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: like a zip code, but more marble" 
Mon May 28 00:35:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i was but one week late to see this exhibition in NYC http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloaca_%28art%29 
Mon May 28 00:35:10 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh glad i wasnt the only one 
Mon May 28 00:35:46 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Sadly the education of people these days is just going down hill 
Mon May 28 00:36:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: what do they have in the uk for zip codes? is it the same phrase? 
Mon May 28 00:36:08 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Post code 
Mon May 28 00:36:38 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: in french it's "code postal" 
Mon May 28 00:36:52 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Yeah! They like to reverse all good ideas 
Mon May 28 00:37:36 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Bit like OSI and ISO 
Mon May 28 00:37:40 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm still not sure if I get the reference 
Mon May 28 00:37:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh i recently read up on the UTC abbreviation 
Mon May 28 00:37:58 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Pantheon - Parthenon - Greek - Marble 
Mon May 28 00:38:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fucking classic 
Mon May 28 00:38:58 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't get how any of those things are like a zip code 
Mon May 28 00:39:03 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Yeah! Was thinking of UTC aS WELL 
Mon May 28 00:39:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's ok deforce. it may just be that drunk guys have a common wavelength and you're not there yet 
Mon May 28 00:39:36 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: As I said, education 
Mon May 28 00:39:58 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You guessed I was drunk huh? :) 
Mon May 28 00:40:12 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's like the force 
Mon May 28 00:40:22 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Which side though? 
Mon May 28 00:40:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: force users notice 
Mon May 28 00:40:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ahh that's the trick then innit. 
Mon May 28 00:41:11 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't get the lewis black thing either, "if it wasn't for my horse I couldn't go to college" 
Mon May 28 00:41:15 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Shit! Breathing coffee don't work 
Mon May 28 00:41:37 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i actually looked into this, because it seemed to me that "2 sith always, 2 sith only" was AWfully restrictive and just plain impractival 
Mon May 28 00:42:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and it looks like lucas has simpyl written himself into a logically impossible corner, really. the sw universe is just a fucking continuity mess 
Mon May 28 00:42:33 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: the masters and apprentices always have students 
Mon May 28 00:42:57 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yeah but according to yoda, the sith number is always exactly 2 
Mon May 28 00:43:19 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Wasn't he supposed to have written "9" episodes? 
Mon May 28 00:43:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that was the legend when i was a kid, ya 
Mon May 28 00:43:53 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: he just meant that there's always a master and an apprentice 
Mon May 28 00:44:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: possibly. but that's shitty writing. you have to interpret it 
Mon May 28 00:44:25 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: and they would be the only ones who could really stand up to a jedi 
Mon May 28 00:44:43 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Makes it damn hard to take over the empire with a force of exactly 1 and yourseld 
Mon May 28 00:44:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that's my point. the sw universe is always about "this meant that, but not this, except in tthe case of etc" 
Mon May 28 00:45:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fans constantly making excuses for crappy continuity 
Mon May 28 00:45:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: dont get me wrong, star trek is actually worse 
Mon May 28 00:45:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and i like sw 
Mon May 28 00:45:29 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Wrong lighting too on ST 
Mon May 28 00:45:41 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but for a franchise with an uber master, you'd think he'd put more effort into continuity 
Mon May 28 00:46:07 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it certainly doesn't help that things were a lot different during the old republic, before the jedi civil war, etc. 
Mon May 28 00:46:19 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Jabba was a man in the original. 
Mon May 28 00:46:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: with an irish accent, no less 
Mon May 28 00:47:05 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: did you see that "young lucas" parody about how he got all the ideas? 
Mon May 28 00:47:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh i saw the first 5 minutes. hilarious 
Mon May 28 00:47:21 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You think C3PO woul make a great front person for the gay rights movement? 
Mon May 28 00:47:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and that's another thing 
Mon May 28 00:48:05 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Incest? 
Mon May 28 00:48:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: how many astromechs are there? 
Mon May 28 00:48:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: is a 4-slot namespace really adequate? 
Mon May 28 00:48:41 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: heh heh 
Mon May 28 00:48:53 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: 26 letters, 10 numbers - quite a namespace actually 
Mon May 28 00:49:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well we know there are r5 and r2 units 
Mon May 28 00:49:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so he can take off two slots for the model type 
Mon May 28 00:50:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: leaving a grand total of 36*36 possible names for individual specimens 
Mon May 28 00:52:22 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: 36!/(2!*34!) - apparently 
Mon May 28 00:53:06 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: 630 
Mon May 28 00:54:42 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Permutaion wise it is 1260

Wed May 30 01:07:01 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Walt Disney (through the Ougia Board) says "FUCK YOU!" 
Wed May 30 01:07:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: r0x0r 
Wed May 30 01:07:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i mean, RACIST

Wed May 30 01:09:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i resent xyzzy for making me chat on this fucking godforsaken channel, and then not even showing up 
Wed May 30 01:09:16 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Bring on the 4th Crusades! 
Wed May 30 01:10:38 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: which two lines? 
Wed May 30 01:10:42 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: gypsy, give me your tears. 
Wed May 30 01:11:08 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: whats the other line? 
Wed May 30 01:11:32 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: or i will take them from you 
Wed May 30 01:11:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they are two separate lines 
Wed May 30 01:11:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: top gear is almost an interesting "programme" 
Wed May 30 01:11:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i watched much of an episode 
Wed May 30 01:12:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but the dude was too much of a breathless fanboi 
Wed May 30 01:12:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: plus the steering wheel was on the wrong side 
Wed May 30 01:12:44 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: what do you expect from a european 
Wed May 30 01:12:48 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: "JEZZA IS GOD!" 
Wed May 30 01:13:48 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Your Post Office have it right. 
Wed May 30 01:14:24 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: are your post trucks backwards too? 
Wed May 30 01:14:36 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Your cars ARE! 
Wed May 30 01:14:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: australia, uk, and...uh...japan 
Wed May 30 01:15:06 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Cars! Heh! Fuels dumps more like! 
Wed May 30 01:15:12 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: what is about island nations and getting traffic flow exactly backward? 
Wed May 30 01:15:50 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: We have a god complex 
Wed May 30 01:16:04 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You ought to try it 
Wed May 30 01:16:18 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Instead of playing it 
Wed May 30 01:17:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: trouble with the brits is they won't accept that they are and want to be german 
Wed May 30 01:17:50 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Our Royalty is German (and Russian) 
Wed May 30 01:17:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the norman dalliance was but a phase 
Wed May 30 01:18:34 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: French! Phht! 
Wed May 30 01:18:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you are saxon and you love your fucking sausages and shitty weather and take inordinate pride in your political and engineering efficiency 
Wed May 30 01:19:02 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: And? 
Wed May 30 01:19:10 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: just saying 
Wed May 30 01:19:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: annex already 
Wed May 30 01:19:26 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You take our engineers and pay them more money 
Wed May 30 01:19:38 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well now see americans 
Wed May 30 01:19:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we are the quintessence of humanity 
Wed May 30 01:19:54 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Ha! 
Wed May 30 01:20:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: none of this regional fartistry 
Wed May 30 01:20:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we are the sum of all strengths and fears 
Wed May 30 01:20:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that is why you envy us 
Wed May 30 01:20:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we are the uber-population 
Wed May 30 01:20:44 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Again! Ha! 
Wed May 30 01:21:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: go on, mock. let your ugly envy show its green eyes 
Wed May 30 01:21:29 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: I have blue eyes 
Wed May 30 01:21:31 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we are what every country would be, given the chance 
Wed May 30 01:21:43 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: "we are the quintessence of humanity" - Since when? 
Wed May 30 01:22:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well it's been era-apropriate 
Wed May 30 01:22:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so, the whole time 
Wed May 30 01:22:41 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i didnt argue for unqualified quintessence 
Wed May 30 01:22:53 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Many an empire has made that quote, see where that got them (including us) 
Wed May 30 01:23:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ah yes, the british lesson 
Wed May 30 01:23:37 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: there are a few things you've taught us 
Wed May 30 01:23:39 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: At least we did what many other nations espired to 
Wed May 30 01:23:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: #1 greed is your one true king 
Wed May 30 01:24:17 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: #1 Which you learnt from us 
Wed May 30 01:24:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: exactly my point 
Wed May 30 01:24:37 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Monkeys learn 
Wed May 30 01:25:11 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: what i find most striking about the uk 
Wed May 30 01:25:31 2007 [free_speech] Tricky is waiting for #2 and on 
Wed May 30 01:25:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: is the ferocity with which you hate each other 
Wed May 30 01:25:57 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yeah #1 was pretty much it actually. we seem to be learning the rest the hard way 
Wed May 30 01:26:15 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Of course we hate! You thought that was Hellmonger's domain? 
Wed May 30 01:26:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well you know 
Wed May 30 01:26:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: white-on-white hate is still weird to me 
Wed May 30 01:26:55 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: How do you think we put up with upstarts like yourself? 
Wed May 30 01:27:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: when i was a kid and discovered that it was a Big Deal a catholic was elected us president 
Wed May 30 01:27:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i was like GTFO 
Wed May 30 01:27:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they shot him dead, in the end, so i guess it worked out 
Wed May 30 01:27:57 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Of course. How did you think it would end? 
Wed May 30 01:28:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: at least he wasnt a drunk 
Wed May 30 01:28:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: thank christ for that 
Wed May 30 01:28:45 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Blond haired, blue eyed catholic -- you really thought the protestant nation would allow him to stay in power? 
Wed May 30 01:29:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: plus he was having too much goddamn fun 
Wed May 30 01:29:13 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Even if he was a Navy hero 
Wed May 30 01:29:25 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i think brits are crypto catholics 
Wed May 30 01:29:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i think they hate the irish because the irish represent authenticity they lack 
Wed May 30 01:30:17 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Err.... No.Just religious is all 
Wed May 30 01:30:31 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ami being racist yet? 
Wed May 30 01:31:03 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: You haven't hit on the spics yet so no 
Wed May 30 01:31:52 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: filthy yorker 
Wed May 30 01:31:55 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Oh yeah! 25 years since we "fracked" the Argies! 
Wed May 30 01:32:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: like i said 
Wed May 30 01:33:42 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: white on white hate is the same as black on black hate. 
Wed May 30 01:33:42 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Falkland Islands -- Not "Malvinas" 
Wed May 30 01:33:48 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: except more nuanced, because we're more civilized. 
Wed May 30 01:34:48 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: How come I get hit if I call a black guy a nigger, yet a black guy can call another black guy a nigger and nothing happens 
Wed May 30 01:35:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you've never been hit in your life, ginger beer 
Wed May 30 01:36:00 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Am I asking the wrong channel? Is this a white only channel? 
Wed May 30 01:36:12 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: Only white people are crazy enough to line up with guns, wearing bright colorful attire, and attempt to shoot eachother. 
Wed May 30 01:36:52 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: only black people are angry enough to charge such a line of skirmishers with melee weapons 
Wed May 30 01:37:00 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: I've been hit, just not by anyone of the "coloured" persuasion 
Wed May 30 01:37:46 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: charging a line with melee weapons isn't really THAT bad of an idea. 
Wed May 30 01:38:02 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: esp if you skirmish with them and watch your range, you can get them to fire, take minimal casualties, and close for the butchery. 
Wed May 30 01:38:17 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Charging a line 2x2 in colourful uniform is though 
Wed May 30 01:40:38 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Maybe that would make Iraq more appealing. Put the troops in fancy uniform 
Wed May 30 01:41:54 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Yeah! Put a big red cross on the uniform. Like I said before, 4th crudade 
Wed May 30 01:44:27 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Get rid of the guns and high explosives and outfit each side with swords 
Wed May 30 01:45:25 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Total Christian vs Muslim fight fest 
Wed May 30 02:06:31 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: dork 
Wed May 30 02:55:44 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: The code is supposed to kill me. 
Wed May 30 02:56:10 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: WoWMud doesn't get this channel 
Wed May 30 02:56:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh 
Wed May 30 02:56:34 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: The pendant is an object of mine 
Wed May 30 02:56:46 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: It is to protect me from being dested 
Wed May 30 02:56:56 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh 
Wed May 30 02:57:16 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Every time Yeik dests it, it regens 
Wed May 30 02:57:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so you werent kidding about it being anti tricky code 
Wed May 30 02:57:30 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Totally fucks him off 
Wed May 30 02:58:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well i'll stop trying to help then, since it's obviously an exercise he should work out on his own 
Wed May 30 02:58:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: interesting, though 
Wed May 30 02:58:22 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Tried to spoof it by transfering that object he is talikng about to my environment and sending me into a jail 
Wed May 30 02:58:54 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Didn't work, just logged off and logged back in 
Wed May 30 02:59:08 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Then dested the offending items 
Wed May 30 03:00:26 2007 [free_speech] Tricky makes a note of the add_action thingy 
Wed May 30 03:00:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yeah i dont think it should work that way 
Wed May 30 03:01:00 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: I really should re-code the destruct() sefun 
Wed May 30 03:01:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: now that might explain it 
Wed May 30 03:01:20 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: That would mess with his mind 
Wed May 30 03:01:30 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: It is based on Lima's ver 
Wed May 30 03:03:34 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Basically... 
Wed May 30 03:03:44 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: void destruct(object ob) { if(!undefinedp(ob)) { if(ob) catch(ob->remove()); } else ob = previous_object(); if(ob) efun::destruct(ob); } 
Wed May 30 03:33:08 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Maybe this is why Yeik is only a Vice-Lord and I am a Lord. 
Wed May 30 03:33:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: disturbing 
Wed May 30 03:33:48 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Strangley, Tim is only a Wiz on WoWMud 
Wed May 30 03:35:32 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Yeik is what I would describe as a "loose cannon" 
Wed May 30 03:38:49 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Ooo... He done that to me 
Wed May 30 10:28:08 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: WHERE YA AT, WHERE YA AT, NOW THERE YA GO, THERE YA GO 
Wed May 30 23:32:25 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: ME I AM COOL 
Wed May 30 23:34:05 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: lies 
Wed May 30 23:39:13 2007 [free_speech] Xyzzy@Dead Souls Demo: would i lie to you? 
Wed May 30 23:54:03 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: yes 
Wed May 30 23:56:15 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: now, would i say somethin that wasnt true 
Wed May 30 23:57:13 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: you would.  definately. 
Thu May 31 00:04:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: faithless cur 
Thu May 31 00:09:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: stop whatcher doin 
Thu May 31 00:09:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: get down upon yer knees 
Thu May 31 00:10:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i got a message for you 
Thu May 31 00:10:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that you better believe 
Thu May 31 00:24:39 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: perish, heretic. 
Thu May 31 00:28:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i am smug in my certainty of your failure to attain everlasting life, shitwit 
Thu Jun  7 18:27:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i thought "shilpa fuckawala" was kinda funny 
Thu Jun  7 18:27:30 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but then, maybe it's uninspired by brit standards 
Thu Jun  7 18:27:38 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Against broadcasting rules 
Thu Jun  7 18:27:56 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fascist brit tv 
Thu Jun  7 18:28:06 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Plus this is the nation that has taken political correctness to a new level. 
Thu Jun  7 18:28:47 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: you mean the place where it's legal to be a criminal? 
Thu Jun  7 18:28:57 2007 [free_speech] Tricky nods 
Thu Jun  7 18:29:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i thought this remark was hilarious: "The word nigger is clearly racially offensive and there was no justification for its use." 
Thu Jun  7 18:29:15 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Against you human rights and all that stuff to be locked up or punished 
Thu Jun  7 18:29:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i was like "you know you *just* said the word?" 
Thu Jun  7 18:29:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1269443,00.html?f=dta 
Thu Jun  7 19:34:19 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: more like "The word 'nigger' is clearly racially offensive when not used by a nigger" 
Thu Jun  7 19:36:21 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: "in other news, a black guy called a white guy a 'honky cracker peckerwood' and everyone was like 'haha the black guy said something funny'" 
Thu Jun  7 21:24:18 2007 [free_speech] Aransus@Pyloros: It kind of annoys me when people refer to 'The N Word!' 
Thu Jun  7 21:24:41 2007 [free_speech] Aransus@Pyloros: Everyone knows what you're talking about, just say the fucking word. It reminds me of how parents will spell out words so the kids don't know what they're saying. 
Thu Jun  7 21:24:46 2007 [free_speech] Aransus@Pyloros: ...only without the effectiveness. 
Thu Jun  7 21:36:54 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's funny how stupid words like that only have so much power because people give it power 
Thu Jun  7 21:38:38 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: if everyone woke up tomorrow and said "I don't care about the word 'nigger', it has no power to make me feel a certain way" 
Thu Jun  7 21:39:00 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: no one would bother using it 
Thu Jun  7 21:40:33 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: but that doesn't happen, because at the end of the day people feel powerful and secure in their victim mindset 
Thu Jun  7 23:35:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh, that reminds me of the south park episode 
Thu Jun  7 23:35:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: where one of the kids tries to train his dog not to be gay 
Thu Jun  7 23:35:55 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: heh.  sparky. 
Thu Jun  7 23:36:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: "don't be gay!" 
Thu Jun  7 23:36:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: people feel how they feel. it's not about wanting to feel insulted 
Thu Jun  7 23:36:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's about feeling insulted. it's not, you know, optional 
Thu Jun  7 23:37:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's like deciding you'll stop caring about iraq 
Thu Jun  7 23:37:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you either care or you dont 
Thu Jun  7 23:37:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you dont really get to push the reset button on some things 
Thu Jun  7 23:39:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: "just...don't be insulted!" 
Thu Jun  7 23:39:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: "oh, ok. well THAT'S better!" 
Fri Jun  8 00:03:17 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I know what you mean, it's just that people are taught to be insulted by words 
Fri Jun  8 00:03:45 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: if someone kicks or punches you, you have to do crazy meditation or something to not feel the pain 
Fri Jun  8 00:04:35 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: if someone says a word, you get to decide if that person has power over you to make 
Fri Jun  8 00:04:46 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: you feel a certain way 
Fri Jun  8 00:05:28 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: like if someone calls you an internet fascist, you know it's not true 
Fri Jun  8 00:10:14 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I didn't know that stating the obvious about how someone's hair works would be considered offensive, until people made a big deal about don imus 
Fri Jun  8 00:11:18 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: but.. crat is an internet fascist. 
Fri Jun  8 00:14:21 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm not black so if someone called me a nigger I would just be confused 
Fri Jun  8 00:15:11 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: but there would be the same kind of anger behind it 
Fri Jun  8 00:15:31 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I just wasn't taught that being called a nigger is offensive to me 
Fri Jun  8 00:22:46 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: are you a nigger? 
Fri Jun  8 00:23:00 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't know if there's any words people could call me as a white guy that would actually be insulting to me 
Fri Jun  8 00:23:26 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: retard 
Fri Jun  8 00:31:11 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: trailer park bitch 
Fri Jun  8 00:31:59 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: "nigger" just means "slave", and slavery's not a black thing, there have been slaves from most societies throughout history 
Fri Jun  8 00:32:01 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: "trailer park bitch" is weak. They get let out of jail early 
Fri Jun  8 01:17:42 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the thing is that there will always be taboo words, and they will change. some words will go taboo, some will untabooize, it's just a normal part of language evolution and is not going away 
Fri Jun  8 01:17:56 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you could say that this is stupid, let's just get rid of that 
Fri Jun  8 01:18:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but you might as well say that the possessive case is stupid, or that pronouns are a waste 
Fri Jun  8 01:18:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's a part of the way people think and speak, it's part of who we are 
Fri Jun  8 01:20:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: "deciding" that taboo stuff is dumb and it won't bother us is much like deciding that our society will be communitarian and we will do away with money. nice idea, maybe someday we'll be able to 
Fri Jun  8 01:20:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but not today 
Fri Jun  8 02:08:52 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm not saying that it's dumb to have taboo words, I'm saying that the people who are offended by them are responsible for them being offensive 
Fri Jun  8 02:11:18 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: A TV program airs and just before it starts it explains that the content may offend some viewers. Why o' why do viewers then phone in to complain about offensive content after watching the *whole* programme? 
Fri Jun  8 02:12:14 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: so I agree that it's a natural part of language, 
Fri Jun  8 02:12:36 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: I also don't get the warnings at 2am that "This program may not be suitable for children". 2AM fer crying out loud. 
Fri Jun  8 02:12:44 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: some people don't understand that if they don't want to be offended than they shouldn't watch 
Fri Jun  8 02:13:52 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's shocking how some people think the whole world should live like their idealized version of the world 
Fri Jun  8 02:14:20 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm shocked you're shocked! and offended! 
Fri Jun  8 02:14:38 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: like the caricatures of muhammed 
Fri Jun  8 02:14:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it is stupid to watch a show that has warnings about offensive language and then be offended by the language 
Fri Jun  8 02:14:56 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: if people are offended by it, fine, they don't have to look at it 
Fri Jun  8 02:15:25 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ah this is a different thing 
Fri Jun  8 02:15:39 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's ridiculous to expect other people to not have pictures of muhammed 
Fri Jun  8 02:15:57 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: for example, when some dude somewhere makes a speech saying it's ok to kill americans 
Fri Jun  8 02:16:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: he's just exercising free speech 
Fri Jun  8 02:16:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if it happens to be an influential cleric, then it's still free speech 
Fri Jun  8 02:16:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: except, of course, it has practical consequences 
Fri Jun  8 02:17:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: because some nutballs can take it as the permission thet they need to kill people 
Fri Jun  8 02:17:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so i think we can agree that some forms of speech have specific effects that are, generally, not good 
Fri Jun  8 02:17:53 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: We have many clerics like that in the UK 
Fri Jun  8 02:18:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: like, say, dead innocents 
Fri Jun  8 02:18:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: in that context, i think it's ok to be upset with the cleric 
Fri Jun  8 02:19:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i think it's all right to say "it was very rude and thoughtless of you to give your followers permission to kill me, and i am offended by it" 
Fri Jun  8 02:20:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you don't even really need to hear the statement or understand the language, etc. it's enough to know that cleric joe smith made the statements, and be mad 
Fri Jun  8 02:20:57 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fuck that jerk 
Fri Jun  8 02:21:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: given this, i think it is similarly ok to be offended if joe cleric says that the thing you believe in most is evil, corupt, and has done nothing but propagate death and pain 
Fri Jun  8 02:22:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: cuz #1 it's not true, and #2 wtf 
Fri Jun  8 02:23:05 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: And yet you aren't allowed to publically make death threats against your President, even if you are just joking 
Fri Jun  8 02:23:11 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: yeah, it makes sense to be offended by ideas 
Fri Jun  8 02:24:10 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: similarly, i think it's ok to be pissed off if the thing you believe in most is ridiculed in racist terms 
Fri Jun  8 02:24:38 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm not saying it's ok to then go on a kill crazy rampage 
Fri Jun  8 02:24:52 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but you're not out in left field being miffed by it 
Fri Jun  8 02:25:30 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's stupid for people to take race so seriously 
Fri Jun  8 02:25:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: race is the most serious thing, unfortunately. we're wired to care about it 
Fri Jun  8 02:25:56 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's genetics 
Fri Jun  8 02:25:56 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: people are divided a lot more by class than by race 
Fri Jun  8 02:26:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well that's true 
Fri Jun  8 02:26:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: on a social and practical level, yes, it's worse to be poor than black 
Fri Jun  8 02:26:36 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: people get distracted by race and ignore all the class oppression around them 
Fri Jun  8 02:26:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but it's telling that they're on the same continuum 
Fri Jun  8 02:28:44 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but look at it this way. you're at a stop light. a group of black teenage boys rounds the corner 
Fri Jun  8 02:28:50 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's fine being black if you're born into the right family and it sucks to be white if you're born into the wrong family 
Fri Jun  8 02:29:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they look at you and notice you're looking at them 
Fri Jun  8 02:29:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they exchange glances, you tense up 
Fri Jun  8 02:29:40 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: what's actually happening is theyre thinking "lookit the nervous white dude thinking we're gonna carjack him" 
Fri Jun  8 02:29:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and a little brick of resentment gets added to the wall
Fri Jun  8 02:30:16 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: yeah, that's how it works 
Fri Jun  8 02:30:38 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so that when one of them hears someone say "nigger", after many many bricks of perceiving white people to be trying to hide their racism 
Fri Jun  8 02:30:43 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it is significant 
Fri Jun  8 02:31:25 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: no, they should realize that everyone is a racist to some degree and not just white people 
Fri Jun  8 02:32:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i guess. but they're just people, and people are dumb, so they dont realize such things 
Fri Jun  8 02:32:37 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: theyre just sick of women tightening their grip on their purses in the elevator 
Fri Jun  8 02:34:51 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it would help if they smiled instead of trying to look as mean as possible 
Fri Jun  8 02:35:35 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: everyone can do something to break the circle, not just white people 
Fri Jun  8 02:36:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i guess 
Fri Jun  8 02:36:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm not looking to assign blame 
Fri Jun  8 02:36:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: really there isn't a fix for it 
Fri Jun  8 02:37:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: people dont trust each other 
Fri Jun  8 02:37:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and people who look different trust each other less 
Fri Jun  8 02:37:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: in the meantime, language reflects this crap 
Fri Jun  8 02:37:33 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: a good place to start is to stop blaming white people for everything and recognizing that everyone is racist sometimes 
Fri Jun  8 02:37:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: like i said, everyone's a pot or kettle in that business 
Fri Jun  8 02:39:22 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's ok to make fun of white people though 
Fri Jun  8 02:39:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: is it? white people drive like this: doot dee doot dee doo! 
Fri Jun  8 02:41:30 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm tired of people being referred to as minorities 
Fri Jun  8 02:42:06 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: but apparently a lot of people are ok with it 
Fri Jun  8 02:42:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: does it really happen that much? 
Fri Jun  8 02:42:40 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: yeah, whenever people talk about demographics 
Fri Jun  8 02:42:56 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's always "white people" and then a breakdown of minorities 
Fri Jun  8 02:43:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: why would that bother you? 
Fri Jun  8 02:43:32 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: isn't it just true? 
Fri Jun  8 02:45:06 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: people aren't minorities, they're just people who have inherited certain DNA 
Fri Jun  8 02:45:42 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it doesn't make them any less of a person 
Fri Jun  8 02:45:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: mmm yes. until they try to get a loan. then they are the sum of the social disadvantages their dna brought 
Fri Jun  8 02:47:27 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: everyone has a wide background though 
Fri Jun  8 02:48:09 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's just silly to categorize people like that 
Fri Jun  8 02:48:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well sure 
Fri Jun  8 02:48:25 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: unless you're running a business 
Fri Jun  8 02:48:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: then people turn into numbers 
Fri Jun  8 02:48:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and sadly, minorities tend to represent the lower numbers 
Fri Jun  8 02:48:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so while you and i can have a beer as equals 
Fri Jun  8 02:48:59 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's also illegal to treat people differently because of their race than someone of another race with the same means 
Fri Jun  8 02:49:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: when we go into the bank 
Fri Jun  8 02:49:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the chances are that our numbers diverge because of race 
Fri Jun  8 02:49:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it doesnt matter than my race is not on the application form 
Fri Jun  8 02:50:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: my numbers are generated by the disadvantages suffered by my family because of racism 
Fri Jun  8 02:50:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the inequality is inherent in the system, not explicit, but just as plain 
Fri Jun  8 02:50:29 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: everyone gets screwed by banks depending on their economic status 
Fri Jun  8 02:50:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: correct 
Fri Jun  8 02:50:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and since the poor are disproportionately minority, the minorities get the brunt of the shaft 
Fri Jun  8 02:51:19 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: people aren't poor because of their race though 
Fri Jun  8 02:51:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that is a complex statement that is right and wrong 
Fri Jun  8 02:51:55 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the poor are poor because they lack money 
Fri Jun  8 02:52:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but they lack money because their family does not have it 
Fri Jun  8 02:52:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and their family does not have for a number of reasons 
Fri Jun  8 02:52:23 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it usually depends on who someone's parents are/were 
Fri Jun  8 02:52:43 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: often one of them is that their ancestors lacked the advantages your ancestors had 
Fri Jun  8 02:53:25 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: that's racist propaganda 
Fri Jun  8 02:53:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if my ancestors were slaves and yours were tradesmen, your family had an advantage over mine that compounded over time 
Fri Jun  8 02:54:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: my position is not racist, it is self-evident. over time, advantage compounds 
Fri Jun  8 02:59:08 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: families aren't just one race though 
Fri Jun  8 02:59:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ok 
Fri Jun  8 02:59:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: how does that refute my position? 
Fri Jun  8 03:08:11 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: race is just a distraction and makes people think that there's really a connection 
Fri Jun  8 03:08:55 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: more black people aren't in prison because black people are more likely to be bad, it's because there are a lot of poor people who happen to be black 
Fri Jun  8 03:09:43 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: and people resort to crime because they're poor, not because of their race 
Fri Jun  8 03:11:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that's what i've been saying 
Fri Jun  8 03:11:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: somehow it sounds like you think we've been disagreeing 
Fri Jun  8 03:11:54 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: there's no real racial advantage though 
Fri Jun  8 03:12:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ah i see 
Fri Jun  8 03:12:14 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I mean, that's what people have been saying about the jews forever 
Fri Jun  8 03:12:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: listen i agree with you 
Fri Jun  8 03:12:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if there's anything i said that made you think there's a genetic reason for advantage, that is a miscommunication 
Fri Jun  8 03:13:04 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: what i've been saying is not that the dna causes the advantage 
Fri Jun  8 03:13:30 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it is that the dna being different made people act in racist ways, generating the disadvantage 
Fri Jun  8 03:14:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and that there is a now a strong correlation between being poor and being a minority, because of that long ago behavior by other people 
Fri Jun  8 03:14:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: which has caused a generational effect we feel still today 
Fri Jun  8 03:15:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so that when i go into the bank for a loan, it is different from when you go into the bank to get a loan (statistically) 
Fri Jun  8 03:15:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: not because i am race X and you are race Y 
Fri Jun  8 03:15:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but because my *ancestors* were race X and yours were race Y 
Fri Jun  8 03:15:38 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: dig? 
Fri Jun  8 03:17:30 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't understand how that matters when families are the descendants of poor immigrants 
Fri Jun  8 03:17:55 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: there is a difference between being a poor immigrant and being a fucking SLAVE, dude 
Fri Jun  8 03:18:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: please tell me you see the diff 
Fri Jun  8 03:18:29 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: that's why I pointed out that families are made up of every race 
Fri Jun  8 03:18:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: go on 
Fri Jun  8 03:27:24 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: maybe I should just kill myself if all people see when they look at me is who my ancestors were 
Fri Jun  8 03:28:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you're not understanding 
Fri Jun  8 03:28:38 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i am not telling you that all people see is your ancestry 
Fri Jun  8 03:28:40 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: well, I don't know how to deal with it 
Fri Jun  8 03:29:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i am telling you that your condition is due in large part to your ancestry 
Fri Jun  8 03:29:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: which should really just be an obvious observation 
Fri Jun  8 03:29:32 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't really see how that works though 
Fri Jun  8 03:29:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i dont understand why you wouldnt see that 
Fri Jun  8 03:29:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: poor people come from poor families 
Fri Jun  8 03:30:02 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's not rocket science 
Fri Jun  8 03:30:22 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's not like we have a rigid caste system 
Fri Jun  8 03:30:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yeah, exceptional people break the mold on occasion 
Fri Jun  8 03:31:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but if yer just like yer dad, and yer dad is poor... 
Fri Jun  8 03:31:12 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the math is not difficult 
Fri Jun  8 03:32:04 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: my grandparents were poor but they worked really hard and made a lot of sacrifices so their kids could get a good education 
Fri Jun  8 03:32:25 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: good for them. their children did better, etc 
Fri Jun  8 03:33:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: are you just determined to not acceptt hat your family has a major influence on you? 
Fri Jun  8 03:33:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i can understand that position 
Fri Jun  8 03:33:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i find much of my family unbearable 
Fri Jun  8 03:34:31 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's just a lot more dependant on someone's parents and grandparents 
Fri Jun  8 03:34:55 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ok. do you see how *they* might be dependent on *their* parents and grandparents? 
Fri Jun  8 03:35:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: how it might go back more than just a couple of generations? 
Fri Jun  8 03:35:35 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: not when people come over as poor immigrants 
Fri Jun  8 03:35:57 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i don't even know what you're arguing anymore. no offense, but you're just not making sense to me 
Fri Jun  8 03:36:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm telling you that your ancestors have significant influence on your situation 
Fri Jun  8 03:36:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you're saying...what...no? 
Fri Jun  8 03:36:35 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: no, I don't disagree with that big picture 
Fri Jun  8 03:36:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ok, then we agree 
Fri Jun  8 03:38:37 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it just doesn't matter that they were related to me 
Fri Jun  8 03:39:09 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: if my great-great-great-grandfather was adopted, it would be the same as if he wasn't 
Fri Jun  8 03:39:21 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: as long as the same people raised him 
Fri Jun  8 03:40:42 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: does that make sense? 
Fri Jun  8 03:40:54 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: thinking 
Fri Jun  8 03:41:10 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yes i agree 
Fri Jun  8 03:41:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you seem to be under the impression that i'm arguing about heredity 
Fri Jun  8 03:42:08 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i am arguing about legacy 
Fri Jun  8 03:42:10 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: so it's relationships that affect people and not their heredity 
Fri Jun  8 03:42:32 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the condition of the group from which they came, not their chemical composition 
Fri Jun  8 03:45:34 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: so if people come over as poor immigrants, and make a better life for their children 
Fri Jun  8 03:45:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh 
Fri Jun  8 03:46:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: look, assume that all humans have the same stats, strength, intelligence, dexterity, charisma, etc 
Fri Jun  8 03:46:26 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: regardless of what they look like 
Fri Jun  8 03:46:58 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I just don't understand why people can't do that regardless of their race 
Fri Jun  8 03:47:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: let's say that green humans were slaves for a long time, then freed. at the same time, orange humans had been free in that country, but poor 
Fri Jun  8 03:47:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the green humans, upon freedom, have a serious disadvantage 
Fri Jun  8 03:47:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it has nothing to do with WHY they are green. they have the same stats as the oranges 
Fri Jun  8 03:48:15 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but they have a harder time finding jobs, getting loans, getting educations 
Fri Jun  8 03:48:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: because in that county, green humans are considered inferior 
Fri Jun  8 03:48:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: meanwhile, the orange humans are doing just great 
Fri Jun  8 03:48:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: not being turned down for jobs 
Fri Jun  8 03:49:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: getting decent loans 
Fri Jun  8 03:49:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: etc 
Fri Jun  8 03:49:09 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: that's not true 
Fri Jun  8 03:49:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: this is a generalization 
Fri Jun  8 03:49:19 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: orange humans can have it just as bad 
Fri Jun  8 03:49:25 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they werent actually green or orange either 
Fri Jun  8 03:49:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: in *general*, as a *group*, slaves and freed slaves had a harder time getting on the progress ladder 
Fri Jun  8 03:50:03 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's not fair to generalize like that though 
Fri Jun  8 03:50:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if you disagree with that, then there's nothing to discuss, you're just divorced from reality 
Fri Jun  8 03:50:43 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: there were people in jails during the industrial revolution 
Fri Jun  8 03:50:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and? 
Fri Jun  8 03:51:03 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: because they were poor 
Fri Jun  8 03:51:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and? 
Fri Jun  8 03:51:39 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: kids forced to work in coal mines 
Fri Jun  8 03:51:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you'r drifting into left field 
Fri Jun  8 03:52:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: are you arguing just to argue? 
Fri Jun  8 03:52:07 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm saying that it's not possible to generalize people by race 
Fri Jun  8 03:52:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you're the one insisting on this 
Fri Jun  8 03:52:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i agree with you 
Fri Jun  8 03:52:37 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i dont know why you keep getting stuck on something that's not happening 
Fri Jun  8 03:55:07 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's a culteral thing and not a race thing 
Fri Jun  8 03:55:15 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: fine 
Fri Jun  8 03:55:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you're arguing against stuff i'm not saying, so either yer drunk or really young 
Fri Jun  8 03:55:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: no fense, but unless you start keeping up, i'm done 
Fri Jun  8 03:56:20 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm just saying that it depends on someone's economic background and not their race 
Fri Jun  8 03:56:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and i've been agreeing with you this *whole time* about that 
Fri Jun  8 03:57:14 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: so if I walk into a bank and I have a solid economic history, I can get a good loan 
Fri Jun  8 03:57:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yep 
Fri Jun  8 03:57:52 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it doesn't matter who my parents or my grandparents were 
Fri Jun  8 03:57:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: wrong 
Fri Jun  8 03:58:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: who your parents or grandparents were probably has a great deal of influence on whether you have a solid economic history 
Fri Jun  8 03:58:26 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that is my point 
Fri Jun  8 03:59:00 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I mean that it doesn't matter how much money they had, if they helped me to get a good education and make money 
Fri Jun  8 03:59:14 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i dont know what you mean by that statement 
Fri Jun  8 03:59:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'll simply limit myself to standing by mine 
Fri Jun  8 04:01:26 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it really depends if people have free will or not 
Fri Jun  8 04:01:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i don't think it does 
Fri Jun  8 04:01:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that is a completely other can of worms 
Fri Jun  8 04:02:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: look i understand this sentiment 
Fri Jun  8 04:02:02 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't really believe in free will, I see it more as an illusion that we create 
Fri Jun  8 04:02:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i was raised in the usa 
Fri Jun  8 04:02:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: everyone here is indoctrinated to bnelieve they can be president if they try hard enough 
Fri Jun  8 04:02:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and at the end of the game, when everything looks bleakest, they can get that winning goal in at the buzzer 
Fri Jun  8 04:03:00 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so, really, i understand what you're saying 
Fri Jun  8 04:03:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'm just talling you that the fantasy has limits 
Fri Jun  8 04:03:36 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and if you dont have money, you need to be an *exceptional* human being to overcome your situation 
Fri Jun  8 04:03:38 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't actually believe in that 
Fri Jun  8 04:03:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and by definition, most people aren't exceptional 
Fri Jun  8 04:04:49 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I see people as being affected by things that happened billions of years aog 
Fri Jun  8 04:05:01 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: and that free will is just an illusion 
Fri Jun  8 04:05:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: good, then let's drop this free will business 
Fri Jun  8 04:05:25 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: but there's still the problem of existentialism 
Fri Jun  8 04:05:33 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: for fuck's sake 
Fri Jun  8 04:05:41 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: are you an actual college freshman? 
Fri Jun  8 04:06:13 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it doesn't matter if people have free will 
Fri Jun  8 04:06:59 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: but there's not some huge conspiracy against people who, at first glance, are a member of a certain race 
Fri Jun  8 04:07:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i've decided you're just yanking my crank. you can't possibly be evading my point this way by accident 
Fri Jun  8 04:07:49 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I just don't like being blamed for things that people did who aren't even my ancestors 
Fri Jun  8 04:08:25 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: my family doesn't have any kind of special advantage 
Fri Jun  8 04:09:53 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: my ancestors had to work hard and make sacrifices just so their kids could have a better life than they did 
Fri Jun  8 04:10:53 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: so I'm just tired of being blamed for everyone else's problems 
Fri Jun  8 04:13:22 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I'm really not trying to evade your point, I'm trying to understand your point 
Fri Jun  8 04:14:42 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I've had to grow up feeling like everything is my fault 
Fri Jun  8 04:17:06 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ok 
Fri Jun  8 04:17:30 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: is it your fault people are being killed in sudan? 
Fri Jun  8 04:17:34 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: no 
Fri Jun  8 04:17:48 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: is it your fault that slavery happened? 
Fri Jun  8 04:17:50 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: no 
Fri Jun  8 04:18:16 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: slavery's been happening for thousands of years 
Fri Jun  8 04:18:20 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: is it your fault that slavery seriously affected people for long after it was abolished? 
Fri Jun  8 04:18:24 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: no 
Fri Jun  8 04:18:40 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it comes from "slav" 
Fri Jun  8 04:18:57 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: no it does not 
Fri Jun  8 04:19:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it comes from latin sclavus 
Fri Jun  8 04:19:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: but aside from linguistic nitpicking 
Fri Jun  8 04:19:29 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: ok, that was a misnomer on my part 
Fri Jun  8 04:20:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if you want to pretend that american slavery had no effect on the descendants of slaves, then you're really out there on your own and i'm not indulging your fantasy 
Fri Jun  8 04:20:27 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I know it had an effect 
Fri Jun  8 04:20:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ok se we agree 
Fri Jun  8 04:20:55 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it's just that people today aren't direct descendants 
Fri Jun  8 04:21:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: oh. really. 
Fri Jun  8 04:21:29 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: and it's not really possible to categorize people into races 
Fri Jun  8 04:21:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: again with the shit i dont know why you're saying it 
Fri Jun  8 04:22:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's my bedtime anyway. good night. it's not your fault, white dude. everything is cool. 
Fri Jun  8 04:23:11 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: people just assume based on appearance 
Fri Jun  8 04:25:27 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: I don't really know if it's worth being alive if everything is predetermined 
Fri Jun  8 04:26:48 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: it seems like there's nothing I can do 
Fri Jun  8 04:31:16 2007 [free_speech] Deforce@Firefly Mud: if there's nothing I can do to help everyone get an equal start, if it doesn't matter what I do to help people if everything is predetermined by previous generations 
Fri Jun  8 04:48:26 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: http://rugose.com/is-funny.gif 
Fri Jun  8 20:31:46 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: 992 complaints to Channel 4 over kicking Emily out for saying nigger. The complaints were *against* kicking her out. 
Fri Jun  8 20:32:52 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 991 were corvin@nanvaent, the other was arren 
Fri Jun  8 20:40:21 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: you fucking nigger. 
Sat Jun  9 05:37:47 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i think so 
Sat Jun  9 05:38:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 1 
Sat Jun  9 05:46:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: hmm 
Sat Jun  9 05:47:55 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: hmm3 
Sat Jun  9 05:48:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well waddaya know 
Sat Jun  9 05:50:25 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: anyway, yes, france is "pourboire compris" 
Sat Jun  9 05:50:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: just pay what the bill says, no need for tipping 
Sat Jun  9 05:51:47 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 2 
Sat Jun  9 05:53:19 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i like france 
Sat Jun  9 05:55:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 4 
Sat Jun  9 05:56:10 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 6 
Sat Jun  9 06:03:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: wow nicole ritchie is obviously mentally challenged...like...clinically 
Sat Jun  9 06:30:47 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ah yes maybe it *is* service rather than pourboire 
Sat Jun  9 06:30:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's ben a while 
Sat Jun  9 06:34:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the most useful bit of dvice is, employ whatever shitty, rusty french you know *first* 
Sat Jun  9 06:35:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: let them take pity on you. they will then meet you halfway with their shitty english 
Sat Jun  9 06:36:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: of course you dont 
Sat Jun  9 06:36:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: that is why it will be helpful 
Sat Jun  9 06:36:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it will be obvious you're making an effort. that's all they ask 
Sat Jun  9 06:36:31 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it is, you know, their country 
Sat Jun  9 06:38:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if you spend a lot of money, that also helps 
Sat Jun  9 06:39:16 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: in general the french are like any other post-imperial nation. show a little respect for the culture, and they'll be eternally grateful 
Sat Jun  9 06:43:44 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: if you cant keep track of spoken numbers, stay away from pigalle 
Sat Jun  9 06:43:56 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: where are you going, anyway? what for? 
Sat Jun  9 06:49:11 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's six hours by car from paris 
Sat Jun  9 06:49:53 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the seaside shit it picturesque, i spose, but i'm not much of a fan of it 
Sat Jun  9 06:50:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: pirate some pimsleur french lessons 
Sat Jun  9 06:51:07 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you'll be back up to speed in no time 
Sat Jun  9 06:52:37 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: 4 
Sat Jun  9 14:17:24 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Crat: Either you were talking to yourself 8 hours ago (about France) or some messages weren't being relayed to me. 
Sat Jun  9 14:20:07 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: http://ebspso.dnsalias.org/i3logs/index.php?chan=free_speech&page=2#line223 
Sat Jun  9 17:36:58 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: wtf 
Sat Jun  9 17:39:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: ? 
Sat Jun  9 17:40:11 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: your shit is bridged? 
Sat Jun  9 17:40:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yeah it only half works. i coded it drunk last night 
Sat Jun  9 17:40:41 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'll be tinkering with it today through my hangover 
Sat Jun  9 17:41:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh, you mean which of the two routers which are part of ds anyway? 
Sat Jun  9 17:43:29 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i think the delay has more to do with irn than anything else. if you used the *i4 router rather than *yatmim i bet you wouldn't see that delay 
Sat Jun  9 17:43:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: not that 1 second more or less on a shit talking channel makes much diff 
Sat Jun  9 17:50:18 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh no not really 
Sat Jun  9 17:50:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i was mostly eager to demonstrate that arren was completely full of shit regarding not "fragmenting the community" 
Sat Jun  9 17:51:03 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: since he didn't lift finger one to do anything about it 
Sat Jun  9 17:51:09 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i am 
Sat Jun  9 17:51:13 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we're reunited 
Sat Jun  9 17:51:23 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: don't it feel good? 
Sat Jun  9 17:52:35 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: yeah. that's the feel good part 
Sat Jun  9 17:53:29 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: Is someone else talking of 'fs'? Is the router forgetting to pass chan packets onto the other router? 
Sat Jun  9 17:53:57 2007 [free_speech] Tricky: I'm on yatmim vtw 
Sat Jun  9 17:53:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: could be. i'll be poking at it tonight.

Sat Jun  9 22:46:03 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: It went like this: "Crat: Let's do IRN". "Arren: ok." "Crat: What forum do you want to have the debate on?" "Arren: WTF, get to the point!" "Crat: I'll just do a bridge. @@@@@@@@@@@" 
Sat Jun  9 22:46:27 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: well no, it didn't quite go like that 
Sat Jun  9 22:46:31 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: So is Crat listening then?

Sat Jun  9 22:46:37 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Because I miss calling him a shitcock.

Sat Jun  9 22:46:47 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: heyhey honey 
Sat Jun  9 22:46:51 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: time to test shit 
Sat Jun  9 22:46:51 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: Crat has been listening for months, in a few minutes, he'll post the authoritative version, probably highlighted in colours. 
Sat Jun  9 22:47:03 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Hot damn, it worked. 
Sat Jun  9 22:47:29 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: tell doesn't work though 
Sat Jun  9 22:47:41 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: eh not really. targeted stuff isnt tested and prolly wont work 
Sat Jun  9 22:47:51 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it's just a regular channel bridge for one channel 
Sat Jun  9 22:47:51 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Hey, the wave worked. 
Sat Jun  9 22:48:01 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: So I'm content with the world. 
Sat Jun  9 22:48:01 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: it only looked like it on your router 
Sat Jun  9 22:48:12 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Was it torqued on your end? 
Sat Jun  9 22:48:22 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: didnt show up at all, afaik 
Sat Jun  9 22:48:36 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Your code obviously. 
Sat Jun  9 22:48:48 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Safest assumption ever: If Cratylus coded it, it probably doesn't work for shit. 
Sat Jun  9 22:48:52 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heh 
Sat Jun  9 22:49:04 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: right. this conerstion is imaginary 
Sat Jun  9 22:49:44 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: invisible nigger? 
Sat Jun  9 22:49:46 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: But I'm glad you're at least kinda here, because I need to get this off my chest: 
Sat Jun  9 22:50:00 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: It is a fucked up world where people can actually make me feel bad for Paris Hilton. 
Sat Jun  9 22:50:22 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: Duuk? What happened to her? 
Sat Jun  9 22:50:32 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: you're a fool. she'll hae a rough coupla weeks and emerge the same insanely rich party girl 
Sat Jun  9 22:50:46 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'll trade with her any ole day of the week 
Sat Jun  9 22:50:52 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: i'll do her jail time for her money 
Sat Jun  9 22:50:58 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: where do i sign? 
Sat Jun  9 22:51:00 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Dude.  She's in the middle of a pissing contest between the sheriff and the judge. 
Sat Jun  9 22:51:14 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: And the only one that is going to lose is poor Paris. 
Sat Jun  9 22:51:16 2007 [free_speech] Alric@nanvaent@Dead Souls: she bought the sherriff 
Sat Jun  9 22:51:41 2007 [free_speech] Alric@nanvaent@Dead Souls: medical condition?

Sat Jun  9 22:53:50 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: it's not fair, she's too delicate to go to jail 
Sat Jun  9 22:54:02 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: she's not like those common bitches 
Sat Jun  9 22:54:10 2007 [free_speech] Alric@nanvaent@Dead Souls: you're biased - you got a yank wife 
Sat Jun  9 22:54:54 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: she's from the south. Yanks are the ones who sound like ducks throwing a hissy fit when they talk 
Sat Jun  9 22:55:06 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: southerners are those slow, retarded sounding ones

Sat Jun  9 22:57:26 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: are you saying he's a cunt ? 
Sat Jun  9 22:57:28 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: because you're a hater 
Sat Jun  9 22:57:42 2007 [free_speech] Alric@nanvaent@Dead Souls: no idea, just I don't usually swaer 
Sat Jun  9 22:57:48 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: No, it's because Crat is black. 
Sat Jun  9 22:57:52 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: He brings us down to his level. 
Sat Jun  9 22:57:56 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: So he can understand the white folks. 
Sat Jun  9 22:58:17 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: are you the emperor of white folks, Duuk? 
Sat Jun  9 22:58:30 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: I don't admit to it in public. 
Sat Jun  9 22:58:52 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: Our shared skin colour really creates a bond

Sat Jun  9 23:27:37 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Postulate: All women want a threesome with 2 guys, much like all guys want a threesome with 2 chicks. 
Sat Jun  9 23:29:03 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: postulate: a woman with 3 boobs must be 50% more exciting than a woman with 2 
Sat Jun  9 23:29:35 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Proof: Total Recall was a great movie. 
Sat Jun  9 23:29:47 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: they were so fake

Sat Jun  9 23:33:59 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: That's what I thought. 
Sat Jun  9 23:35:50 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Like you don't put a dick in your mouth when you use a vibrator. 
Sat Jun  9 23:36:43 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: And why do you think there's such a huge market for vibrators? It's because men are no bloody good. 
Sat Jun  9 23:37:04 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Most men. 
Sat Jun  9 23:37:44 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Tigers need a damn closer.

Sat Jun  9 23:46:45 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: lip piercings are fun 
Sat Jun  9 23:47:07 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: No, they prevent adequate sexiness while giving head. 
Sat Jun  9 23:48:11 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: you have a typical male perspective 
Sat Jun  9 23:48:21 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: repeat after me, lip and tongue piercings are good

Tue Jun 12 23:50:38 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@trilogy@Dead Souls: What is the importance of batting order, and how is it decided? 
Tue Jun 12 23:50:56 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: the manager decides it

Tue Jun 12 23:51:28 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: because if you're good, you can put people in order so that your best "on base" guys go first, and your best "homerun guy" bats 4th 
Tue Jun 12 23:51:34 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Depends which league 
Tue Jun 12 23:51:40 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: in the National League, every player playing bats

Tue Jun 12 23:52:44 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: The host park determines the rules. 
Tue Jun 12 23:52:53 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: So if you're playing in an AL park, there is a DH 
Tue Jun 12 23:52:59 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: If you're playing in an NL park there is not 
Tue Jun 12 23:53:05 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@trilogy@Dead Souls: can the pitcher be his own DH? 
Tue Jun 12 23:53:17 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Yes, but he wouldn't 
Tue Jun 12 23:53:23 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Pitchers usually suck as batters. 
Tue Jun 12 23:53:29 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Also, why risk having your pitcher get hurt? 
Tue Jun 12 23:53:49 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@trilogy@Dead Souls: well, i imagine if he's batted for the previous 200 games, he might not suck that bad at it. 
Tue Jun 12 23:53:57 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@trilogy@Dead Souls: whereas an NL team would'nt even have a DH, no? 
Tue Jun 12 23:54:01 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: You'd be surprised. 
Tue Jun 12 23:54:05 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Right. 
Tue Jun 12 23:54:13 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: but they'd just let one of their other players do it 
Tue Jun 12 23:54:23 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Like when San Fran plays an AL team, Barry Bonds is usually the DH 
Tue Jun 12 23:55:01 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@trilogy@Dead Souls: so they set the batting order up so he'd never be adjacent to the pitcher? 
Tue Jun 12 23:55:13 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: huh? 
Tue Jun 12 23:55:13 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Oh, no. 
Tue Jun 12 23:55:19 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: teams have more players than play every day 
Tue Jun 12 23:55:49 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: So they can rotate people in and out.  the DH is just a guy that isn't assigned an actual position (since he's batting for the pitcher) 
Tue Jun 12 23:55:49 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@trilogy@Dead Souls: ah 
Tue Jun 12 23:56:07 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: So like if Maglio Ordonez is the DH, someone else is playing center field 
Tue Jun 12 23:58:35 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@trilogy@Dead Souls: ah

Wed Jun 13 02:50:11 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Proceeds to do a stripclub style dance and use the angle grinder on the thong to get directional sparks 
Wed Jun 13 02:50:33 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: The judges end up just sat there going 'O.O .........' they forget to hit the damn buzzer thing 
Wed Jun 13 02:50:57 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: And Simon wosshisname .. cowell? claims that she turned him on 
Wed Jun 13 02:51:17 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Simon Cowell isn't on Americas Got Talent is he?

Wed Jun 13 02:52:35 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Redneck tenors and guys who break things with their arse. woowoo 
Wed Jun 13 02:52:51 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: I thought the rednecks doing mozart were good actually

Wed Jun 13 02:53:36 2007 [free_speech] Tatianna@nanvaent@Dead Souls: though american inventor is just painful to watch 
Wed Jun 13 02:54:18 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: I wonder if the ant and dec simon cowell thing is on youtube 
Wed Jun 13 02:54:22 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: We had a weird one where the audience votes the people off... once 50% of the audience have voted them off they're kicked off and they win based on who can stay on the longest with a maximum limit of 2 minutes. And I swear. Every act was so unbelieveably shit 
Wed Jun 13 02:54:32 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Probably Arr, Probably 
Wed Jun 13 02:55:46 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Yep, it is http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=britain%27s+got+talent&search=Search

Wed Jun 13 02:56:52 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: How can you find so many inept acts? 
Wed Jun 13 02:57:20 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: Well, it was difficult to do a 2 minute build up because everyone will press the button in the two minutes, so it turns the traditional act design on its head. Some people didn't get the hang of that. 
Wed Jun 13 02:57:42 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: That's true. It totally shafted people who were doing say.. standup comedy 
Wed Jun 13 02:57:56 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: In 2 minutes you haven't got time to get the audience laughing properly 
Wed Jun 13 02:58:18 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: And I noticed half the acts would get 20-25% voted off before they'd even fucking started 
Wed Jun 13 02:59:08 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Usually they were niggers! 
Wed Jun 13 03:00:12 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: I did see one act that got to 2 minutes though 
Wed Jun 13 03:00:53 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Two male models doing what looked like the dance from Grease while wearing masks of various celebrities 
Wed Jun 13 03:01:15 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: That is NOT continuous, they have a safety margin I could drive my car through. 
Wed Jun 13 03:01:51 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Yes Arr, but we don't want to drive the car through the gap.. we want to drive over the people, yes we do 
Wed Jun 13 03:02:01 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: And we'd best reverse again afterwards just to be sure 
Wed Jun 13 03:02:29 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Oh how I wish bullbars were still legal :P 
Wed Jun 13 03:03:23 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: The way to win it is to be young, cute, and play a polyphonic instrument. 
Wed Jun 13 03:04:17 2007 [free_speech] Marajin@andromeda@Dead Souls: Or be sexy and outrageous so that simon lets you through cause he wants to get laid 
Wed Jun 13 03:05:37 2007 [free_speech] Arren@anarres ii@Dead Souls: Bianca Ryan has some of Whitney Houston's vocal production in her stronger register, but she doesn't produce it so well higher up.

Wed Jun 13 20:03:42 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: why is a watch stolen in albania sold in australian dollars ? 
Wed Jun 13 20:07:49 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: It's international pirate currency. 
Wed Jun 13 20:07:55 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Prison colony, etc 
Wed Jun 13 20:08:49 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: a guy I know who grew up in that region has been volunteering ethnic stereotypes about Albanians for years. Them stealing your watch if you shake their hand was definitely one of them 
Wed Jun 13 20:11:13 2007 [free_speech] Dexter@nanvaent@Dead Souls: The british only colonized australia because they lost the carolina territories & georgia as prison colonies when the French won your revolution for you 
Wed Jun 13 20:11:59 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@haven@Dead Souls: Brits just can't accept that they were all talk and got beat by militia.

Thu Jul 12 19:06:16 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: So, if the Democrats had ANY fuckin balls, they'd demand the end of the war. 
Thu Jul 12 19:06:33 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: im sure theyll find SOME way to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory 
Thu Jul 12 19:06:39 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: and when Bush vetoes that bill, they can either 1) override the veto or 2) use it as a campaign item for '08 
Thu Jul 12 19:06:53 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: Never underestimate the political stupidity of the Democratic party.

Thu Jul 12 19:08:55 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: so, you ARE changing the world? 
Thu Jul 12 19:08:55 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: or you just KNOW how to 
Thu Jul 12 19:08:59 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: The GOP calls me and begs for money about once a quarter.  And I get invited to the annual Michigan leadership conference, where I'll pepper the MI-GOP about how we're going to win in 2008. 
Thu Jul 12 19:09:09 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: And I'll likely be on the ballot next year for my district.

Thu Jul 12 19:10:01 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: Michigan's economy is badly fucked, and I'm sick of our know-nothing governor blaming business and threatening to raise taxes ona  state that is bordering on bankruptcy as-is 
Thu Jul 12 19:10:25 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: Do you even know who your congressman is?

Thu Jul 12 19:11:52 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: what a burden 
Thu Jul 12 19:12:02 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: Plugh, you obviously have no clue what you're talking about.

Thu Jul 12 19:16:13 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: And then I told you how to get that done. 
Thu Jul 12 19:16:19 2007 [free_speech] Duuk@Haven: Now shut up and email your congressman.

Thu Jul 12 19:34:05 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: personally i think americans just need to stfu about immigration 
Thu Jul 12 19:34:21 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: the economy would collapse without indentured labor 
Thu Jul 12 19:34:23 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: crack down on it or stfu 
Thu Jul 12 19:35:17 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: we actually benefit outrageously from the millions of illegals we practically invite in on a red carpet 
Thu Jul 12 19:35:39 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: and it's that outrageous benefit that makes it laughable that we'd ever actually put a stop to it 
Thu Jul 12 19:35:45 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: so, in short, stfu 
Thu Jul 12 19:35:59 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: cuz if we were *really* serious

Thu Jul 12 19:39:16 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: but you also keep the cheap labor happy by not actually DOING anythign about it 
Thu Jul 12 19:39:36 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: everyone's happy 
Thu Jul 12 19:40:12 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: heard an interview with a restaurant owner

Thu Jul 12 19:44:49 2007 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls Demo: except those that do their laundry, care for their children, do their landscaping, and slaughter their food

Fri Jul 13 15:17:40 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: instead of callin them "soldiers", they refer to them as "warfighters" 
Fri Jul 13 15:18:58 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: next theyll be called "bringtojusticers" or "freedomspreaders" 
Fri Jul 13 15:32:56 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: there is actually a difference between a warfighter and a soldier 
Fri Jul 13 15:33:38 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: warfighters are actually the ones who do the fighting, whereas a soldier could be a janitor. 
Fri Jul 13 15:36:00 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: so, "soldier" just means "someone who is in the military", 
Fri Jul 13 15:36:00 2007 [free_speech] Plugh@Dead Souls Demo: whereas "wrfighter" means "someone who shoots teh bullets at teh badguys"? 
Fri Jul 13 15:38:40 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: right. 
Fri Jul 13 15:38:52 2007 [free_speech] Hellmonger@Trilogy: it's slang for high speed infantry

Sat Aug 23 17:35:08 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: Now would be a good time to disable your free_speech channels. At least for the next few minutes. 
Sat Aug 23 17:35:23 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: Everybody duck! 
Sat Aug 23 17:35:41 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: Whoa.

Sat Aug 23 17:45:25 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: I blame teh intarmudz. 
Sat Aug 23 17:45:46 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: remember there is a max string size limit that intermud doesn't circumvent except through oob file packets 
Sat Aug 23 17:45:54 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: damnit. 
Sat Aug 23 17:46:01 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: which actually break up the string

Sat Aug 23 17:46:41 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: Ah. the Encyclopedia dramatica 2142-line longcat didn't work :( 
Sat Aug 23 17:46:42 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: free speech, fag 
Sat Aug 23 17:46:52 2008 [free_speech] Kalinash@Fire and Ice: fuck you pole smoker 
Sat Aug 23 17:47:09 2008 [free_speech] Raudhrskal@Dead Souls: may i finally ask... b& stands for "bend", "banned" or both depending on context? 
Sat Aug 23 17:47:22 2008 [free_speech] Kalinash@Fire and Ice: banned 
Sat Aug 23 17:47:27 2008 [free_speech] Kalinash@Fire and Ice: b-and 
Sat Aug 23 17:47:35 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: if you wanna go IRC-ish, K-lined! 
Sat Aug 23 17:48:44 2008 [free_speech] Raudhrskal@Dead Souls: yah. Well, sometimes when it was used in hate-sessions at intergossip it definately looked like "bend"... you know what i mean... 
Sat Aug 23 17:49:04 2008 [free_speech] Kalinash@Fire and Ice: that's because they're all fags over there 
Sat Aug 23 17:49:11 2008 [free_speech] Kalinash@Fire and Ice: i like this channel :) 
Sat Aug 23 17:49:34 2008 [free_speech] Raudhrskal@Dead Souls: i just added it. My fault, thought i loaded it the first day ;) 
Wed Aug 27 17:51:12 2008 [free_speech] Kalinash@Fire and Ice: you rat-faced son of a whore! 
Wed Aug 27 17:51:17 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape whacks Kalinash@Fire and Ice upside the head with a clue-by-four! 
Wed Aug 27 17:51:36 2008 [free_speech] Kalinash@Fire and Ice: i need to fix emoteto's :( 
Wed Aug 27 17:51:45 2008 [free_speech] Emsenn@Canland: Do you have that aliased, Shadyman? 
Wed Aug 27 17:51:50 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: it's an emote, yes. 
Mon Sep  1 07:27:20 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: You brush Troll softly in the torso with your bag. 
Mon Sep  1 07:27:58 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: You brush Troll softly in the face with your tea bag. 
Mon Sep  1 07:28:05 2008 [free_speech] Shadyman@QuantumScape: bingo. 
Mon Sep 22 05:06:09 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: test

Mon Sep 22 05:06:27 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: fucking faggot ass fuckbrain 
Mon Sep 22 05:06:32 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: RACIST FUCK 
Mon Sep 22 05:06:51 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: Wait. This is pretty much ig material. 
Mon Sep 22 05:06:58 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: heh 
Mon Sep 22 05:06:59 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: What can we say to make this different? 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:01 2008 [free_speech] Fizban@Dead Souls: rm -rf * 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:04 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: racist stuff 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:13 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: I'm not sure I have it in me :( 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:14 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: rm -rf 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:23 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: it's really hard, isn't it 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:31 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: Yeah 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:33 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: actually dropping the n-bomb where it'll be logged forever 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:41 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: ig gives me all the freedom I need 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:49 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: And it's not about logging or lack thereof, it's just... 
Mon Sep 22 05:07:56 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: i hear ya man 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:01 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: About even contemplating doing it. It's just not in me. 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:09 2008 [free_speech] Fizban@Dead Souls: that you aren't racist or sexist? 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:22 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: I probably am, at some degree, but there's limits, y'know 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:32 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: I mean, we all recognize and deal in stereotypes 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:34 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: ill be honest with you guys 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:36 2008 [free_speech] Fizban@Dead Souls: wel, there's conscious racism and subconscious 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:40 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: Some of which are racial 
Mon Sep 22 05:08:41 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: since we're on free_speech and all 
Mon Sep 22 05:09:04 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: i made this channel mostly so i could say "hey shitheels, go to the channel where you can say whatever you want" 
Mon Sep 22 05:09:22 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: knowing it was very unlikely anyone would actually use it 
Mon Sep 22 05:09:29 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: i know, it makes me a shitty person 
Mon Sep 22 05:09:37 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: but there it is. the truth 
Mon Sep 22 05:09:51 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: Well, I'm assuming one thing 
Mon Sep 22 05:09:58 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: You can't get banned on here 
Mon Sep 22 05:09:59 2008 [free_speech] Fizban@Dead Souls: why does that make you a shitty person heh? 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:10 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: well it makes me kind of duplicitous 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:12 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: So I'm sure you've banned people from ig, right 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:17 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: oh yes 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:34 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: Therefore, I'm sure the people who have been banned from ig would have preferred to use this channel rather than ig 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:35 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: but mostly my bans are channel bans, not router bans 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:39 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: yeah 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:43 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: but they never do 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:46 2008 [free_speech] Fizban@Dead Souls: Wait people get banned yet I've made it this far without being banned? 
Mon Sep 22 05:10:57 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: you have to really fuck up to get banned 
Mon Sep 22 05:11:03 2008 [free_speech] Cratylus@Dead Souls: i usually warn a bunch of times 
Mon Sep 22 05:11:07 2008 [free_speech] Sinistrad@Dead Souls: So what stops this from being the "default" channel, instead of ig? You don't HAVE to be racist on here, but if you want to be, you can't get banned
